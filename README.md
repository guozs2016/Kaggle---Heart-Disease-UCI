# Kaggle---Heart-Disease-UCI
This is a Heart Disease Prediction Neural Network based on dataset on kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
I apply a neural network with basic pre-processing of dataset to reach a 88.52% accuracy.

Size of Dataset: (303,14)

- /data/heart.csv 
    data used to train and test the neural network
- Accuracy.png 
    A accuracy-epoch figure in neural network training
- HDNN.py 
    A python file to run algorithm in Heart Disease Neural Network Classifier.ipynb directly.
- Heart Disease Neural Network Classifier.ipynb A
    Python Notebook including model building, training and analysis based on data given.
- Loss.png
    A Loss-epoch figure in neural network training
